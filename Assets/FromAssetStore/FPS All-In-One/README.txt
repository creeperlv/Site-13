First Person AIO is an Open Source first person controller for the Unity Engine. It offers many customization options while still being beginner friendly and easy to set up.
The Code and Prefab included are free to use in both commercial and non-commercial applications.*

This Package currently includes features such as:
- Automatic Reticle generation
- Dynamic Footstep sound effects
- Dynamic Head bobbing
- Built in Stamina system
- And much more to play around with, and even more to come!

For best Demo Scene visuals, install the Post Processing Stack (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/post-processing-stack-83912) and allow the lighting to bake. However, this is not required. 

NOTICE:
    - If something isn't working right away, I encourage you to look through all the inspector elements in the prefab and read the tool tips.
    - The Demo Scene included in the package contains audio assets not created or owned by me, and thus are not to be used for commercial applications.
    - The Shader Asset 'Bumped Glass' is a modified asset from the "Standard Assets" package and is not owned by me, thus is not to be used for commercial applications.
    - * All other assets in the Demo Scene were originally created by Aedan Graves and are free to use in non-commercial applications only.
    - if you've added a feature that you think should be added to the package, email the modified script with a change log entry on the top of the script to 'modifiedassets@aedangraves.info' . I will review the changes and update the package.

    
And of course, have fun! ~ Aedan Graves
