When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.:R;&#xD;Description: Moved to Site-13 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures.:R;&#xD;Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.:R;&#xD;The reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and blood. Origin of these materials is unknown. The enclosure must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.:R;&#xD;:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Update 2010.5.1:&lt;/b&gt; SCP-173 is contained in a new container now, it will automatically clean itself, personnel are no need to enter the chamber to clean and record." /><SingleData Name="SCP-001-J" Data="&lt;b&gt;Item #:&lt;/b&gt; SCP-001-J:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Object Class:&lt;/b&gt; Keter:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Special Containment Procedures:&lt;/b&gt; The location of Site-00, where SCP-001-J is to be kept, must remain an absolute secret. To this end, Site-00 will be guarded entirely by automated defense systems and have no living staff whatsoever. SCP-001-J itself will be kept locked in a cube made entirely from tungsten carbide, which is itself inside of another cube made of tungsten carbide, which will, in turn, be placed at the bottom of a three-kilometer long elevator shaft. Multiple molly-guards have been carefully placed over SCP-001-J, and the robots on Site-00 will be prepared to replace these guards if needed.:R;&#xD;Description: SCP-001-J is big, red, shiny, strangely appealing button that just begs to be pushed.:R;&#xD;SCP-001-J is a self-destruct mechanism that Foundation scientists believe is powerful enough to destroy reality itself, consisting of a circular red button set into a metal case. It looks like candy.:R;&#xD;The mechanism by which SCP-001-J operates is not fully understood but it would be awesome to find out.:R;&#xD;SCP-001-J induces a mild psychic compulsion upon all beings who see it or hear it described to try to push it. You know you want to!:R;&#xD;History: SCP-001-J was first discovered by President ██████████ of ███████████████ in ██/██/████, in an elevator car. At that time, SCP-001-J looked exactly as it does now, except for the addition of a sticky-note that said: &quot;If you push this button, you'll destroy everything.&quot; The President managed to fight his compulsion to press SCP-001-J long enough to remove SCP-001-J from the elevator and lock it in the closet of his office. Afterward, he contacted ██████████████████████████████, known to us as &quot;The Founder,&quot; and charged him with creating a special organization with the specific goal of preventing SCP-001-J from being pressed, either by careless accident or by deliberate malice, and also with the goal of &quot;protecting humanity from monsters and stuff.&quot; ██████████████████████████████ agreed, took SCP-001-J, and hid it under a pile of old socks in his basement. ██████████████████████████████ spent the remainder of his life sitting on his porch, using a shotgun to fend off miscreants on his lawn who were suspected of being SCP-001-J sympathizers. The millions of dollars he made on the stock exchange were used to create a trust fund that was the basis of our Foundation.:R;&#xD;Since ██████████████████████████████ died and the Foundation was set up to replace him, there have been █████ attempts to press SCP-001-J. Before Site-00 was relocated to Antarctica [DATA EXPUNGED], there were many near-breaches of containment when Foundation personnel attempted to press SCP-001-J &quot;to see what would happen&quot; and had to be terminated. There have also been numerous attempts by the Foundation's enemies to retrieve SCP-001-J, particularly the Order of the Sacred Button-Pushers, who have sworn to stop at nothing to capture and press SCP-001-J." /><SingleData Name="SCP-1346" Data="&lt;b&gt;Item #:&lt;/b&gt; SCP-1346:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Object Class:&lt;/b&gt; Safe:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Special Containment Procedures:&lt;b&gt; Due to its immobile nature, the original facility housing SCP-1346 has been commandeered to serve as its containment site. The SCP is to be kept under observation, and unauthorized entry denied, but requires no other special security measures.:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks to GOC's technology, although we cannot naturalize it however, we successfully teleported it to Site-13, it is now located in Site-13's Contain Zone. No special procedures required.:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt; SCP-1346 is a corridor, 3.5 m by 3.5 m and 130 m in length, located in the subbasement of the former ███████████████ Research and Engineering Center. The entrance is marked by a heavy steel door, 3.5 meters to a side and almost 45 cm thick. An identical door sits closed at the opposite end of the hallway. The passageway itself is a seamless, cement corridor having no other doors, windows or alcoves. The ceiling has regular lighting placements; however, due to the effects of SCP-1346 everything past 60 meters has proven impractical to maintain, rendering the last half of the corridor dark and in disrepair.:R;&#xD;The corridor's anomalous nature manifests at approximately 50-60 meters along its length. Shortly after crossing the 50 meter threshold, electronic devices begin to malfunction. At about the same point, subjects report hearing clicking, tapping and other mechanical sounds, though not from any clear source. Ear plugs and other audio dampening measures neither diminish nor eliminate these sounds, according to witnesses. To date none of these noises have been verified remotely.:R;&#xD;During this period, subjects start to report feelings of apprehension which intensifies the longer they remain in the passageway, and the further along it they traverse. Eventually some fear or dislike the subject harbors will begin to manifest into a fully-fledged phobia. Subjects with predispositions towards achluophobia, claustrophobia, bathophobia or other immediately present conditions will respond accordingly. Others may begin to hallucinate, imagining the presence of some entity or condition drawn from their psyche. At around 90-100 meters, or if more than 10 minutes have been spent in the anomalous zone, the subject becomes overwhelmed with fear, attempting to retreat from the passageway as quickly as circumstances will allow.:R;&#xD;In most subjects, the feelings of fear and anxiety subside immediately upon exiting the corridor. Many express confusion and embarrassment at their overreaction, and can often be persuaded to reenter (although this invariably has the same result.) A minority retain a fear of the passage, in some cases resulting in long term psychological trauma. Some subjects may subsequently deny the existence of the hallway or its unusual properties, growing agitated and hostile if pressed on the topic. Whether these are natural psychological reactions or some aspect of SCP-1346 is not known at this time. Severe reactions are more likely to manifest the more often a person is exposed.:R;&#xD;Addendum 1346-A: Blueprints of the facility include the subbasement and the hallway, as well as both vault doors, but nothing beyond the far doorway. Interviews with former staff indicate that while there was some awareness that the hall was, “odd,” it was ignored. Observation of staff suggests that most people, left to their own devices, have no curiosity about the subbasement and seem to unconsciously avoid it. Sonic imaging has revealed the presence of several rooms beyond the far vault door, but the nature and contents of these are unknown.:R;&#xD;Addendum 1346-B: Testing has revealed the presence of a strong electromagnetic field in the anomalous region of the corridor, including an unusual pattern of rapid microwave pulses. These probably account for the persistent electronic malfunctions, and may also play at least a partial role in the psychological reactions of test subjects. These wave and pulse patterns appear similar to those studied in Project Pandora, a military research program dealing with the effects of electromagnetic radiation. The source of this radiation is unknown and it continues to be generated unabated even when power to the subbasement is severed.:R;&#xD;&lt;color=red&gt;You Have No Permission to View Extra Documnets&lt;/color&gt;:R;" /><SingleData Name="SCP-001" Data="&lt;b&gt;Item #:&lt;/b&gt; SCP-001:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Object Class:&lt;/b&gt; Olympia:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Special Containment Procedures:&lt;/b&gt; SCP-001 is now contained in Site-13:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt;:R;&#xD;&lt;color=red&gt;[Level 5 Authority Required]&lt;/color&gt;:R;" /><SingleData Name="Subject-Sakura" Data="&lt;b&gt;Object Class:&lt;/b&gt; Euclid:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Special Containment Procedure:&lt;/b&gt; Subject-Sakura is now contained in Site-13, inside a box with 2 SRAs around to keep it in a status of dormancy.:R;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt; Subject-Sakura is a 500 years old girl who is originally named &quot;Yae Sakura&quot;, has a power of control reality.:R;" /></Database>
