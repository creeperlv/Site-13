The Global Occult Coalition was a Group of Interest created by Kain Pathos Crow in the early days of the SCP Foundation wiki. Inspired by a creepypasta about how the Soviet Red Army killed God in the 1950s, it postulated the existence of a separate, but equally powerful, force in the paranormal world. If the SCP Foundation was dedicated to finding, capturing, and containing paranormal objects, the Coalition would be dedicated to a much different, more direct approach: outright destruction of the paranormal.:R;&#xD;GOC is now actually managing the Foundation.

" /><SingleData Name="SCP-1346" Data="SCP-1346 is a corridor, 3.5 m by 3.5 m and 130 m in length, located in the subbasement of the former ███████████████ Research and Engineering Center. The entrance is marked by a heavy steel door, 3.5 meters to a side and almost 45 cm thick. An identical door sits closed at the opposite end of the hallway. The passageway itself is a seamless, cement corridor having no other doors, windows or alcoves. The ceiling has regular lighting placements; however, due to the effects of SCP-1346 everything past 60 meters has proven impractical to maintain, rendering the last half of the corridor dark and in disrepair.:R;&#xD;The corridor's anomalous nature manifests at approximately 50-60 meters along its length. Shortly after crossing the 50 meter threshold, electronic devices begin to malfunction. At about the same point, subjects report hearing clicking, tapping and other mechanical sounds, though not from any clear source. Ear plugs and other audio dampening measures neither diminish nor eliminate these sounds, according to witnesses. To date none of these noises have been verified remotely.:R;&#xD;During this period, subjects start to report feelings of apprehension which intensifies the longer they remain in the passageway, and the further along it they traverse. Eventually some fear or dislike the subject harbors will begin to manifest into a fully-fledged phobia. Subjects with predispositions towards achluophobia, claustrophobia, bathophobia or other immediately present conditions will respond accordingly. Others may begin to hallucinate, imagining the presence of some entity or condition drawn from their psyche. At around 90-100 meters, or if more than 10 minutes have been spent in the anomalous zone, the subject becomes overwhelmed with fear, attempting to retreat from the passageway as quickly as circumstances will allow.:R;&#xD;In most subjects, the feelings of fear and anxiety subside immediately upon exiting the corridor. Many express confusion and embarrassment at their overreaction, and can often be persuaded to reenter (although this invariably has the same result.) A minority retain a fear of the passage, in some cases resulting in long term psychological trauma. Some subjects may subsequently deny the existence of the hallway or its unusual properties, growing agitated and hostile if pressed on the topic. Whether these are natural psychological reactions or some aspect of SCP-1346 is not known at this time. Severe reactions are more likely to manifest the more often a person is exposed." /><SingleData Name="RPC Authority" Data="&quot;People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it.

When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.:R;&#xD;Description: Moved to Site-19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures.:R;&#xD;Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and any change in this behavior should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.:R;&#xD;The reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and blood. Origin of these materials is unknown. The enclosure must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis." /></LoadingScreenText>
