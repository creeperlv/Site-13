# What Happened to Site-13

This game is baed on **djkaktus**'s SCP-1730 [SCP-1730](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1730)

This repo is a clean refresh repo of *What Happened to Site-13*, original repo which is hosted on AzureDev contains some files larger than 100MB, so I cannot directly import codes from the original repo. Besides, this repo has nearly reached 7GB that will reach the repo limitation of AzureDev, so it have to be transferred to GitHub.

Old history can be found [here](https://dev.azure.com/extGOC/_git/What%20Happened%20to%20Site-13), on AzureDev.

## About This Branch

Main development activity of Site-13 is on this branch.

## About this game

I started this project in the year of 2018 when I was at Grade 3, senior high school. Then after I graduated from school, when I was modifying some models, it crashed. So I remade the game. It's the version 0.1.82.x. Some codes are from old versions and modified a lot.

## Why not HDRP

HDRP is proved to be buggy with DX12 on my computer. Also, HDRP will effect performance greatly. Upgrading such a large project to HDRP is too costly.

## Build by you own

Download Unity 2019.4.0f1 (64-bit) on you computer, Windows 10 2004 is recommended. 64-Bit OS is required.

**Note**: Do not use Unity3D on Linux, it has serious bugs, I tried, trust me!

Then download the whole source code. You can start your own build.

## Plug-in system

~~It worked in old version, in this new version, I decided to use 'Site-13-IL' which is not published yet to become the platform that powers plug-in system.~~

It's to hard to make an IL on my own, old one is back with much more powerful and new APIs.

## Replaced old thrid-party FPS controller

It was replaced by ~~FPS-All-In-One and I modified it~~ a self-made FPS controller, it is cleaner and more suitable for this game. The old FPS controller is to buggy and old, the one from FPS-All-In-One is also old and too heavy.
